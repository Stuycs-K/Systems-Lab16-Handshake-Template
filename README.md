# Systems-Lab16-Handshake

Fill in the function definitions for server_handshake and client_handshake in pipe_networking.c.

These should do everything needed to establish a 3-way handshake between the client and server.

Make sure you include diagnostic print messages in your functions.

To remove files, there is a simple function remove(PATH) that will remove the file at PATH.

You should not modify any other files for this assignment.
